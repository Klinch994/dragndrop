# DragNDrop in Unreal and Unity 3D Editors
## Introduction
DragNDrop is a common feature of game engine editors, that allows us to easily manipulate assets inside our game environment. This guide aims to introduce DragNDrop functionality to new users, in both Unreal and Unity 3D. 
## Motivation
DragNDrop is the preferred method of asset manipulation in game development due to its intuitive and visual nature, allowing users, especially those new to the field like Junior Artists, to effortlessly interact with and position assets within the scene. This method reduces the learning curve and enhances productivity by providing a direct and tactile means of arranging and organizing elements, fostering a more user-friendly and efficient workflow.
### Unreal Engine
#### Unreal UI Components
In order to understand how DragNDrop works in Unreal Engine Editor, we need to familiarize ourselves with its UI. The breakdown of the UI components in Unreal Engine can be seen below:

1.	Viewport: Provides a visual representation of the game world or level, allowing users to see and interact with the scene, manipulate objects, and observe gameplay elements.
2.	World Outliner: Displays a hierarchical list of all the actors (entities) in the current level or scene, allowing users to manage, organize, and manipulate these entities.
3.	Details Panel: Offers comprehensive information and editable properties of the selected actor or asset, enabling users to fine-tune and configure their characteristics.
4.	Content Browser: Serves as a central hub for all project assets, containing meshes, textures, materials, blueprints, and other resources used in the game development process.
#### DragNDrop Use Cases
##### UI and Editor Customization
DragNDrop is applied in creating user interfaces or customizing the Unity Editor layout by dragging and dropping windows or panels as can be seen in the GIF below:

##### Scene Building
DragNDrop allows for easy placement of assets (like models, prefabs, or UI elements) into the scene view to build the game environment, as can be seen in the GIF below:

##### Asset Importing
DragNDrop simplifies importing assets (textures, models, audio files) into the Unity project by dragging them from the file explorer directly into the project folder, as can be seen in the GIF below:

##### Component Assignment
DragNDrop is used to assign components (scripts, materials, shaders) to game objects, as can be seen in the GIF below:
